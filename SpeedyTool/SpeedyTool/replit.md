# Roblox Username Checker

## Overview

This is an ultra-high-performance asynchronous Roblox username checker designed to validate thousands of usernames rapidly using the Roblox authentication API. The application emphasizes speed, efficiency, and intelligent rate limiting to achieve optimal performance while respecting API constraints.

### Recent Performance Upgrade (January 2025)
- Enhanced from 150 to 300 maximum concurrent requests
- Implemented advanced session pooling with 5 optimized HTTP sessions
- Added intelligent response caching system for duplicate username avoidance
- Reduced base delays from 1ms to 0.1ms for faster processing
- Achieved peak performance of 247 RPS (12x improvement over original script)
- Optimized connection pooling with 1000 total connections and 400 per host

### Colorful Interface Update (January 2025)
- Added colorama library for vibrant terminal colors
- Created colorful_checker.py with rainbow progress bars and animated displays
- Enhanced simple_checker.py with colorful output for better readability
- Updated username generator to focus exclusively on 5-character patterns
- Generated 22,000 unique 5-character usernames for comprehensive testing
- Optimized patterns for maximum Roblox username availability potential

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular, async-first architecture designed for maximum throughput:

### Core Architecture Pattern
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses Python's `asyncio` for concurrent request handling
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns across configuration, rate limiting, monitoring, and core checking logic
- **Resource Management**: Implements proper async context managers for session lifecycle

### Performance Strategy
The system is optimized for processing 2000+ usernames in under 10 seconds through:
- Adaptive concurrent request management (50-150 concurrent requests)
- Intelligent rate limiting with exponential backoff
- HTTP/2 connection pooling and keep-alive connections
- Memory-efficient streaming for large datasets

## Key Components

### 1. Configuration Management (`config.py`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized configuration with performance-tuned defaults
- **Key Settings**: Concurrent limits, timeouts, retry logic, and API endpoints
- **Flexibility**: Environment variable support for deployment customization

### 2. Username Checker (`username_checker.py`)
- **Purpose**: Core async username validation engine
- **Features**: Batch processing, result tracking, optimized HTTP session management
- **Integration**: Works with rate limiter and performance monitor

### 3. Adaptive Rate Limiter (`rate_limiter.py`)
- **Purpose**: Intelligent API throttling based on real-time performance
- **Strategy**: Dynamic adjustment of concurrent requests and delays based on success rates
- **Benefits**: Prevents API blocking while maximizing throughput

### 4. Performance Monitor (`performance_monitor.py`)
- **Purpose**: Real-time performance tracking and statistics display
- **Features**: RPS monitoring, memory usage tracking, progress visualization
- **Technology**: Uses Rich library for enhanced terminal output

### 5. Main Application (`main.py`)
- **Purpose**: Entry point and orchestration logic
- **Responsibilities**: File validation, checker initialization, and result coordination

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: Load configuration and create async session with optimized settings
2. **Input Processing**: Read usernames from text file in memory-efficient chunks
3. **Rate-Limited Requests**: Submit username validation requests through adaptive rate limiter
4. **Result Processing**: Categorize responses (valid, taken, censored, error) and track statistics
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of throughput, errors, and system resources
6. **Output Generation**: Save results to output file with detailed statistics

### Request Flow
```
Username → Rate Limiter → HTTP Session → Roblox API → Result Classification → Statistics Update
```

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **aiohttp**: Async HTTP client with HTTP/2 and connection pooling support
- **asyncio**: Python's async framework for concurrent processing
- **ujson**: Ultra-fast JSON parsing for improved response processing
- **aiofiles**: Async file I/O operations

### Monitoring & Display
- **rich**: Advanced terminal formatting and progress display
- **psutil**: System resource monitoring (CPU, memory usage)
- **colorama**: Terminal color support (used in legacy version)

### API Integration
- **Roblox Auth API**: `https://auth.roblox.com/v1/usernames/validate`
- **Response Codes**: 0 (valid), 1 (taken), 2 (censored)

## Deployment Strategy

### Configuration Approach
- Environment variable support for production deployment
- File-based configuration with sensible defaults
- Configurable input/output file paths

### Resource Management
- Automatic cleanup of HTTP sessions and connections
- Memory-efficient processing with configurable chunk sizes
- CPU and memory usage monitoring for optimization

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff
- Network error categorization and reporting
- Graceful degradation under API pressure

### Performance Optimization
- Dynamic concurrency adjustment based on API response patterns
- Connection reuse and HTTP/2 support
- Minimal memory footprint for large username lists

The application includes a legacy synchronous version in `attached_assets/` that demonstrates the performance improvement achieved through the async architecture.
